# A-Pathfinding-In-Unity
A* Pathfinding 'game' in Unity with a lot of bad code ( I'm not a pro at all ) and probably a load of bugs!

Use:

Adding walls:
- Click on a tile to add a wall
- Press 'A' and 'Left mouse button' to drag mouse around while fast placing walls
- Press 'Z' and 'Left mouse button' to drag mouse around while fast removing walls

Moving around:
- Press 'Middle mouse button' while moving mouse around

Zooming:
- Use scroll wheel


Known bugs I can't fix :'(
- View image(s) in project in the 'Bugs' folder
